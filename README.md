cpp
#include <iostream>
This line includes the iostream library.
It provides input and output functionalities, such as printing to the screen or reading from the keyboard.

cpp
using namespace std;
This line allows you to use the standard namespace without writing std:: before standard functions and objects.
For example, you can write cout instead of std::cout.

cpp
int main()
This line defines the main function of the program.
The execution of the program starts from here.

cpp
{
This marks the beginning of the main function’s body.
All the code inside the curly braces {} will be executed.

cpp
// This line will print the message hello world
This is a comment line.
The compiler ignores it; it is only for explaining the code to the programmer.

cpp
cout << "Hello World!";
This line prints the string "Hello World!" to the output (usually the screen).
cout is used for output, and << is the insertion operator that sends the text to the output stream.


cpp
}
This marks the end of the main function’s body.
